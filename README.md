This project is a frontend application designed to simulate an online electricity bill management system. It provides users with an easy-to-use interface to view, calculate, and manage their electricity usage and billing details. The focus of this project is to demonstrate clean UI design, responsive layouts, and smooth user interactions while offering a practical real-world use case. Although it functions primarily on the client side, it showcases how digital utility services can be represented in a clear and user-friendly manner. Future enhancements may include integrating backend support, user authentication, and real-time bill tracking features.
